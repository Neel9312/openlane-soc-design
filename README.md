RTL-to-GDSII physical design flow using OpenLANE & Sky130 PDK | VSD SoC Design and Planning Workshop.

## Digital VLSI SoC Design and Planning — RTL to GDSII

> A 2-week hands-on workshop on complete RTL-to-GDSII flow for digital VLSI SoC design, organised by **VSD (VLSI System Design)** in collaboration with NASSCOM. This repository documents my learning, lab outputs, and key takeaways from each day.

### Day 1 — Inception of Open-Source EDA, OpenLANE & Sky130 PDK

**Understanding the Chip Package**

When we look at any embedded board and point to what we call the "chip," we're actually looking at the **package** — a protective casing around the actual silicon die. The real chip sits in the centre of this package and communicates with the outside world via **wire bonding** — tiny wires that connect the chip's pads to the package pins.

**Inside the Chip: Core, Pads, and Die**

Zooming into the chip itself, all signals between the chip and the external world pass through **pads** placed around the periphery. The region enclosed by the pads is called the **core** — this is where all the actual digital logic lives.
